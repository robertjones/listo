        <p id='type_description' class="leading-normal mt-1 mb-2 text-grey-dark text-left">For 3-8 players. Read aloud the challenge on the card and then start a timer for 30 seconds. All players write down their answers. When the time ends go through each of the first player's answers to see if there are any matches with other players. Then go through the remaining answers for subsequent players. Players keep their own score. Rotate the role of first player clockwise after every turn.</p>
